# Slut-projekt / Master Thesis: Samuel Palmer Te4

## This file is for describing my master thesis project that I will create for my portfolio.

## Description

The project will be a launcher that can download GitHub projects via links and then compile and run them. This is supposed to make it a lot easier to use GitHub as an inexperienced person as that was one of the things that hindered people from trying each others programs in year 1-3 in NTI. I believe that with this app, that can also teach you basic Git, will be very helpful for making everyday things faster.
